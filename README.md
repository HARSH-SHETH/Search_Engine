# Data Structure Assignment:
## Build a `Small Search Engine` using searching and sorting.
## Search Engine: 

> A general search engine is an Internet portal through which a person can search numerous compiled resources for topic-related information. Common general search engines include Google, Yahoo!, Alta Vista and Bing. To perform a search, the user enters a word or phrase. 

## About:

> What a Search Engine basically does is, it finds a particular "Sentence and its related content" on a click and then it goes on backside, it searches  each word in the sentence which is present in one particular Sentence and its nearest related and relevant contents that is available in Internet among millions of Web Pages. Search Engines uses Web crawling, Indexing and Searching to find the particular "search" in Internet.

## Analogy between "Search Engine" vs "Mini Search Engine":

> * Millions of Webpages  ==   Two Text Documents
> * Input Field  ==  Input stream of your IDE
> * Page Rank searching  == Linear Searching
> * Sorting  == Sorting most relevant at top
> * UnFound Match in WebPage  ==  Add the Unfound Search into one text document
> * Found match - it opens all Relevant WebPages in Browser ==  Found Match - it Opens One Webpage in Browser


## Searching & Indexing Technique :

### GOOGLE SEARCH ENGINE:
>PageRank is technique used by Google Search Engine to Rank the Website based on the Number of incoming links to the website.Google Bot is used for Indexing the New Webpages and the process used is Crawling. 

### MINI SEARCH ENGINE:
>Linear Search Technique is used to search through text files where more than 100 elements are available to search. Each of the Element is indexed and stored. When a search is made, all the relevant words searched through each element(a line) and gives out INDEX when maximum match of words in an element occurs.A match is not found then the particular is search is indexed and then added to the text file.

## HOW TO USE :

+ You should have any linux distro installed on your system`(Currently tested on Ubuntu 18.04)`.

+ Clone this repository using: `git clone https://github.com/HARSH-SHETH/Search_Engine`.

+ Give execution permission to `run.sh` file using: `chmod u+x run.sh`.

+ Now, If you are using `bash shell` just type: `./run.sh` in your terminal and the script will run the program.

+ If you are uisng `zsh shell`, then use `bash ./run.sh`

+ Enter the keywords you want to search and choose any one url(it will be open in your default browser)

## NOTE: 
  > The project is not finished yet, I will be adding necessary changes to it.
